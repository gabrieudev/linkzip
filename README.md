# URL Shortener

Please select your preferred language:

- [English](README.md)
- [PortuguÃªs (Brasil)](README.pt-br.md)

This is a simple URL shortener project, developed using HTML, CSS, and pure JavaScript. The project allows users to shorten URLs, with the option to customize the shortened link, and also track the number of clicks on their URLs using a [REST API](https://github.com/gabrieudev/url-shortener), which was also developed by me.

## Features

- **URL Shortening**: Enter a long URL and receive a shortened version.
- **URL Customization**: Customize the shortened link (optional).
- **Click Tracking**: Track how many times the shortened URL has been clicked.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Basic structure of the interface.
- **CSS3**: Styling and responsive layout.
- **JavaScript**: Business logic, DOM manipulation, and API interactions.
